Welcome to Geoportal of Adriatic-Ionian region's Documentation.

Here you can find information on how to access and use the Adriatic-Ionian Geoportal (GAIR), built to support the analysis and risk assessment within the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and 
Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) processes, and to be a concrete tool for the EUSAIR Action Plan implementation.

The *GAIR* has been created within *PORTODIMARE project*: geoPORtal of TOols & Data for sustaInable Management of coAstal and maRine Environment* (https://portodimare.adrioninterreg.eu/) *ADRION* programme,
which has put together the technical and scientific skills necessary for the best achievement of the intended objective.
