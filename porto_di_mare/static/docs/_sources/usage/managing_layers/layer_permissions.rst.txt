Changing the Layer Permissions
==============================

.. warning:: This function is enabled only for GAIR signed in user, and according layer permission.

| By default only owners and related group can edit and manage layers, signed in user can download, and anyone can view them.

In order to modify the Layer *Permissions* settings you have to click the :guilabel:`Change Layer Permissions` button in the the left side of *Layer page*.

Through the *Permissions Settings Panel* you can add or remove permissions for users and groups.

You can set the following types of permissions:

* *Edit Data* allows to change attributes and properties of the layers features;
* *Edit Style* allows to change the layer style;

.. note::
	| Maybe you need to change also the default Permissions settings, according to the visibility you want for the layer on the geoportal.
	| Remember to assign the permissions to your staff group, so all the group members will have those permissions.
	| The name of the groups are coded  PDM+partner abbreviation (e.g.: PDMRER, PDMCORILA, etc.). If you start entering the digits, a drop down menu will show possible autofill keys. 

Click on :guilabel:`Apply Changes` to save these settings. A message confirm if permissions succesfully updated.
