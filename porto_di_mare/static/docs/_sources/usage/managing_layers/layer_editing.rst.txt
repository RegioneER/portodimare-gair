   The Layer Editing panel

In that panel you can see many options grouped by four categories:

1. *Metadata*

   Editing the Layer Data

The *Attribute Table* panel of the *Layer* will automatically appear at the bottom of the *Map*. In that panel all the features are listed. For each feature you can zoom to its extent by clicking on the corresponding *magnifying glass* icon |magnifying_glass_icon| at the beginning of the row, you can also observe which values the feature assumes for each attribute.
