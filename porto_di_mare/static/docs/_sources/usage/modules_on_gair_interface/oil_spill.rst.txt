OIL SPILL Module on GAIR
=========================

| Coastal Oil Spill Vulnerability Assessment module implementation in GAIR consists of a risk map based on COMADEX index developed in HAZADR project (https://www.hazadr.eu/).
| The map collect two coastal vulnerability layers (Adriatic sea and Italian Jonian sea) with a vulnerability score for Environmental Component and Human uses and a Total vulnerability score.
| The map shows the monthly sum of COMADEX index collected from 2019 data in 12 different layers in two seasonal groups.
| Enabling different COMADEX monthly layers (even all) will help to imagine different scenarios for Oil Spill hazard.
| The user can estimate a Oil Spill hazard marine area (optionally draw it with Measure Area tool) and adjust the map view to the part of the coastline involved to have a quick view of the
| vulnerability score and its components.
