Working with Layers
====================

| Layers are published resources representing raster o vector spatial data sources. 
| Layers can also be associated with metadata, ratings, and comments.
| This guide's section explains how to navigate layers in GAIR, how to explore detailed information, and of course if you are an authenticated user, how to create a new layer by uploading 
| a local data set, add layer info, change the style of the layer and share the results.
