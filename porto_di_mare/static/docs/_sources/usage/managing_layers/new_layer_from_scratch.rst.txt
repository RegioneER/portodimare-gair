Creating a Layer from scratch
=============================

An interesting tool that GAIR makes available to you is the *Create Layer*. It allows you to create a new vector layer from scratch. The *Layer Creation Form* is reachable through the :guilabel:`Create Layer` link
from the :guilabel:`Data` dropdown menu of the navigation bar (at the top of the page), shown in the picture below.

   :align: center
   :name: create_layer_link

In order to create the new Layer you have to fill out the required fields:

* *Name*
* *Title*
* *Geometry type*

  .. figure:: img/geometry_types.png
   :alt: Geometry types
   :align: center
   :name: geometry_types

Usually the layers features should have some *Attributes* that enrich the amount of information associated with each of them. Through the :guilabel:`Add Attribute` button you can add new attributes.

.. figure:: img/new_layer_from_scratch.*

   :name: new_layer_from_scratch

At this time you can also change the default *Permissions* settings, see :ref:`layer-permissions` to learn how.

Once the form has been filled out, click on :guilabel:`Create`. You will be redirected to the *Layer Page* (see :ref:`layer-info`). Now your Layer is created but is still empty, no features have been added yet. See the :ref:`layer-editing` section to learn how to add new features.
