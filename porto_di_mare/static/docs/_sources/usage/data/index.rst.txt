=====

Data management tools built into GAIR allow for integrated creation of data (e.g. layers), documents and map visualizations.
Each dataset in the system can be shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific users.

The following sections will explain more in depth what data can be managed in GAIR and how to easily find that data.
