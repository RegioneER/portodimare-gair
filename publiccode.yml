    longDescription: |
      The Geo data portal of Adriatic Ionian Region (GAIR) is a community-based,
      open source portal based on GeoNode
      ([http://geonode.org/](http://geonode.org/)),  a web-based Content
      Management System (CMS) for developing geospatial  information systems
      (GIS) and for deploying spatial data infrastructure  (SDI).


      GAIR provides access to numerous datasets related to coastal and  marine
      areas and to several modules for Integrated Coastal Zone  Management
      (ICZM) and Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) analysis and risk  assessment.


      In particular, the already implemented tools are:


      - Module for Cumulative Effects Assessment (CEA)

      - Module for Maritime Use Synergy and Conflict Analysis Tool (MUSC)

      - Module for Supporting Allocated Zones for Aquaculture (AZA)
      identification

      - Module for particle/conservative contaminants dispersion (PAR TRAC)

      - Module for Coastal Oil Spill Vulnerability Assessment

      - Module for Small Scale Fishery Footprint (SSF)

      - Module on Medium Scale Fishery Footprint (MSF) & Cumulative Effects
      Assessment on SSF & MSF.


      The Geoportal capitalizes data from other projects (e.g. Shape,  Adriplan)
      and integrates existing databases/portals developed at  European and
      national level. GAIR thus represents a relevant and original instrument
      that improves  concretely the support to  transparent and efficient
      decision-making  processes and transnational cooperation between the
      Adriatic and Ionian  Region Countries on maritime and marine governance
      and services and on  the implementation of ICZM/MSP processes. For the
      same reason, GAIR is  an important support to the EUSAIR Action Plan
      implementation,  cross-cutting to the 4 Pillars of the Strategy.


      GAIR is developed under _geoPORtal of TOols & Data for sustaInable
      Management of coAstal and maRine Environment_
      ([https://portodimare.adrioninterreg.eu/](https://portodimare.adrioninterreg.eu/))
      _ADRION_ programme.
