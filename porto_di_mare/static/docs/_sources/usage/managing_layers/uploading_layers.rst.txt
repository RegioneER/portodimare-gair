Layers Uploading
================

.. warning::
	| Remember: only authenticated user can upload layers.

| The most important resource type in GeoNode is the *Layer*. A layer represents spatial information so it can be displayed inside a map.

The *Layer Uploading* page can be reached from the :guilabel:`Upload Layer` link of the :guilabel:`Data` drop dow menu in the navigation bar.

| Through the :guilabel:`Choose Files` button (or dropping) you can select files from your disk, make sure they are valid raster or vector spatial data. 

.. note::
    | Maybe you need to change also the default Permissions settings, according to the visibility you want for the layer on the geoportal. 
    | Remember to assign the permissions to your staff group, so all the group members will have those permissions (see :ref:`layer-permissions` for further information on how to set permissions).

.. note:: 
	| Also remember to fill in the metadata section appropriately (see :ref:`layer-metadata` for further information on how to to fill in the metadata).

| Select the *charset*, then click on :guilabel:`Upload files` to start the process or click :guilabel:`Clear` to remove all the loaded files form the page.

   Shapefile Uploading

In this example the ``foul ares poligons`` ESRI Shapefile, with all its mandatory files (`.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf` and `.prj`), has been chosen.
A progress bar shows the operation made during the layer upload and alerts you when the process is over.
When the process ends click the :guilabel:`Layer Info` to check the layer has been correctly uploaded.

The next paragraphs explains how to create a layer from scratch, how to set permissions, how to explore the layer properties and how to edit them.
